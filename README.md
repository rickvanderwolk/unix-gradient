# Unix gradient

A long-running color generator that changes every second, driven by the Unix timestamp. Based on calculations starting from the Unix epoch on January 1, 1970, it will produce new gradients for the next 8.9 million years. Designed for both Philips Hue lights and web interfaces, Unix Gradient offers a vast range of color combinations and a constantly evolving visual experience.
